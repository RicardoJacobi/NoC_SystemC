# NetworkOnChip
Development of a Network on Chip Simulation using SystemC.

This is the final project of the course Silicon Systems Modelling at University of Brasília @ 01/2017.

## Objectives

This project has as final objective the development of a NoC with the following characteristics:

### Router Architecture

The NoC Router will have the following characteristics:

 * Routing - Using XY-Algorithm.
 * Switching Scheme - Wormhole Switching.
 * Flow Control - Handshaking Signal based.
 * Arbiter Scheme - Round-Robin Algorithm. \*
 * Using VC (Virtual Channel)

\*As a development decision the arbiter scheme changed from FCFS (First Come First Serve).

The messages will be divide in packets with N-flits with 32-bits depth. The first flit will be used as header
to allocate network resources to be used by the following data flits.

The Header flit will divided as:

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\| source ID (8 bits) | destination ID (8 bits) |                       packet size (16 bits) |

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The subsequently flits after the header will be responsible to only carry the data.

A packet size can range its size from 2 to 2^16 + 1.

Currently the message only has a single packet. #ISSUE-15

### Network Interface Architecture

The NoC NI will have the following characteristics:

 * Back-End - Responsible for encapsulate/desencapsulate the message in a group of packets to be send by the router.
 * Front-End - Used as wrapper to make sure the different PE can communicate through the NoC.

### Processor Elements

The NoC will be used in MpSoC with elements developed by other groups. The following PE are expected to be connected in
our NoC:

 * Risc-V Processor
 * MIPS Processor
 * Graphic Unit
 * Shared Memory
 * Criptographic Unit
